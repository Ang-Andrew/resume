\section{SKILLS} 
\vspace{0.1in}
  {\bf Leadership}
    \begin{itemize} % Use \item[] to prevent a bullet from appearing
      \item[] ·	In group projects, I strive for a leadership role as it provides an opportunity to develop a relationship with team members and clients, while also solving engineering solutions. Striving for the role of project leader have led me to accomplish successful projects. In addition, I have gained excellent interpersonal, management and leadership skills by applying myself as a team leader. I am able to take responsibility and lead a wide range of projects with full accountability.
      \end{itemize}

{\bf Strategy and Project Management} 
       \begin{itemize}
        \item[] ·	Various projects I have encountered requires high-level problem solving and decision making. Combined with experiences gained from both academia and personal projects, it allows me to implement appropriate strategies to fit the situation. Examples of these situations consists of project requirements and restrictions, team member disputes and unforeseen project events that require mitigation. As a practical person, I learn best from hands-on experiences. The experiences I have gained will definitely play a crucial role in future team projects.
    \end{itemize}

  {\bf Communication} 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Communication is an important medium that allows the exchange of ideas and solutions. I believe that communication is essential for any areas of employment, particularly in engineering consultation due to meeting demands and specifications. I posses both excellent verbal and written communication skills gained from experiences at University and during employment. I use my communication skills to facilitate discussions between team members in projects, provide performance feed back to individuals and provide an effective presentation of complex material, to audiences of varying skills.
       \end{itemize}
